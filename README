ClickGame by vortex

You WILL need SFML to compile this project.
If you are on Linux, install the libsfml package from your package manager
of choice.

I used v8vc to develop this project. v8vc is my personal version control
system based on organizing releases with simplicity. However, v8vc is not
for public use.

Feel free to contact me at v8@firemail.cc
I will respond to all e-mail that is relevant to ClickGame.
